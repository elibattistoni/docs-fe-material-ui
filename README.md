# material-ui-resources

Repository containing miscellaneous material about the React Library Material UI (https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/).

Library that provides us a bunch of UI elements, that are ready to be used so there is non need for you to create them from scratch and reinventing the wheel. These elements implement some of the design best practices, therefore your app will have them as well.

In the components menu on the original website (https://mui.com/material-ui/react-button/) there are all the components that you can use inside your React app.
